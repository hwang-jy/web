# WEB
I start a small project to learn the web.
I'm trying to create a basic community site.

I wrote below what I used for development.
- Node Express
- MySQL
- Pug
- Docker
- Middle ware & etc...
  - Passport.js
  - OAuth 2.0
  - Google Strategy
  - Connect-Flash
I wrote more about the project in [Notion](https://nifty-sunscreen-d4b.notion.site/Community-dac54f8e290f4edf8f0b2d96a2c15bd2).
